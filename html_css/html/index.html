<!-- 
Display -> it controls how an element is rendered on the page. 
does it take full width? does it go to new line?
can ir have width/height? does it take padding or margin?

display:block-> e.g. div, p, h1-h6, header, footer, main
  -it starts on a new line.
    -takes 100% width by default.
    -you can set height, width, margin, padding

display:inline-> e.g. a, em, strong, span 
      -does not start in new line
      -takes only content width
      -cannot set height, width
      -top and bottom margin are ignored
      -padding works but doesn't fully support it

display: inline-block
        -stays inline, pros of inline inherit (lincha) and cons chia replace garcha by block
        -does not start in new line
        -takes only content width
        -can set height, width, width, margin, padding

display: none-> kei pani dekhaudaina, padding margin, height, width remove garxa


display: flex -> it gives us flexibility/flexible box layout
      - it handles only 1D at a time.
      - Turns an element into flex container
      - It's children becomes flex item
      - default behaviour
            flex-direction: row;
            justify-contain: flex-start: //this is usde for row.
            align-items: stretch; //this is used ofor column
                 
            output: item| item| item

            flex-direction: row | column;
            justify-content: flex-start | center| space-between | space-around;
            align-items: stretch | center | flex-start | flex-end;

            flex-wrap: -> should row overlfow or not. wrap|nowrap
            default : flex-wrap: nowrap:
                 - it tells a flex container whether items should stay on one line(nowrap) or flow onto multiple lines(wrap) when they run out of space.

position : static (it is by default)
static-Default
 -element stay in flow.
 -cannot be moved by top/left/right/bottom

relative - element stays in flow but can be shifted.
  -It moves relative to it's original positon 
  -the space occupied stays there.
absolute - element is removed from it's normal flow.
  - it looks for it's nearest positioned and ancestor (non-static ancestor)
  -if none found, the viewport becomes the reference.
  -the ancestor becomes the reference.

  fixed - Like absolute but , the coordinate is always the viewport.
   - It doesn't care about parents.
   -It doesn't move when scrolling.
   - It is premanently pinned to the screen.

sicky - it has a dynamic coordinate system.
 - it acts like relative in normal flow, bu when scrolling, it reaches threshold and switches to fixed.
 - it is limited by it's parent's box, meaning it cannot escape it's container.

we have top, left , right that accepts value.

z-index - when two or more items are stacked on each other, we can use z-index to determine who comes first and who goes to last.
